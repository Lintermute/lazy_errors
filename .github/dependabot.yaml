    # Dependabot can only handle direct dependencies in `Cargo.toml`,
    # but not transitive ones that are only part of `Cargo.lock`.
    # When a direct dependency needs an update, Dependabot will create a PR
    # that does _not_ update transitive dependencies. Since the PR
    # may have an outdated `Cargo.lock`, the build will fail.
    # Thus, we disable Dependabot for Cargo here until Dependabot is fixed.
