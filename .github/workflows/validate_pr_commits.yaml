# Runs the CI quality gate: compilation, linting, testing, dependency checking,
# and so on, on every single commit that would be added by the pull request,
# each time the pull request receives a new push or is (re-)opened.
#
# Does NOT validate the result of the merge; see `validate.yaml` for that.
# This pipeline is a "rebase --exec" variant of `validate.yaml`.
#
# Please note the following refs:
#
# - github.ref      → refs/heads/$branch_name, resp. refs/pull/$pr_id/merge
# - github.ref_name → $branch_name, resp. $pr_id/merge
# - github.head_ref → $source_branch_name, e.g. "feature/foobar"
# - github.base_ref → $destination_branch, e.g. "dev/0.1" or "main"

    # Commits on `dev/*` have already been checked individually.
    # Additionally, at the time of a release (i.e., when merging to `pub/*`),
    # some checks might not work anymore. For example, clippy may have gotten
    # new lints, or there may be a new versions of some dependency. Such an
    # issue would be fixed on `dev/*` first. But even then, some of the
    # thorough checks defined in this pipeline will fail for "old" commits
    # on `dev/*`. Note that we still run `validate.yaml`, of course.
    # That pipeline will check both the HEAD of the PR source branch,
    # as well as what would be the result of the merging the PR to `pub/*`.
